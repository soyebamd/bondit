We are accepting applications from around the world (in English).

In partnership with BondIt, a film & media fund based in Beverly Hills, ScreenCraft is offering between four and ten production grants per year to talented filmmakers for short film and online series that display originality, vision & exceptional potential. Grant amounts will vary from $10,000 to $20,000 depending on the scale and merit of the project. We also offer matching funds for crowd-funding campaigns – see the Application Guidelines for specific details. This program includes creative development from the ScreenCraft team and production guidance and resources from BondIt and Buffalo 8 Productions.
